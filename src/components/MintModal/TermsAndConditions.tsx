The Site allows you to acquire Non-fungible Tokens[1] (“Collectibles,” “NFTs”) that are derivative of the NOUN266 NFT, which is Token #266 of the Nouns Collection, an NFT collection from the Ethereum smart contract with the address of 0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03 (“NOUN 266 NFT,” “NOUN 266-derived NFT”).

To help make the Site a secure environment for the acquisition of NOUN266-derived NFTs, all users are required to accept and comply with these Terms. You agree that by accessing the Site and/or acquiring the NOUN266-derived NFTs, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.

**GOVERNING LAW**

These Terms and your use of the Site and the acquisition of NOUN266-derived NFTs are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law principles.

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

**Informal Negotiations**

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms (each "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree first to attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

**Binding Arbitration**

If the Parties cannot resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. **YOU UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER THIS PROVISION, YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.** The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA Website: http://www.adr.org. The AAA Consumer Rules shall govern your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If the arbitrator determines such costs to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will decide in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in the State of Delaware. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration for any reason, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware. The Parties hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be unlawful or unenforceable, and a court of competent jurisdiction shall decide such Dispute within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

**Restrictions**

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures, and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

**Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration**

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. Suppose this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable. In that case, neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above. The Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

**CORRECTIONS**

[1] *“NFTs” or “Non-Fungible Tokens” means non-fungible, cryptographic tokens, assets, or other such term describing an asset on a Blockchain possessing unique identifiers or other metadata that distinguishes such asset from other tokens or assets on a Blockchain in a manner that makes such asset irreplaceable and unable to be exchanged for a similar token or asset of like-kind or nature. For example, a CryptoPunk represents the uniqueness of an asset’s intellectual property rights. A position on the Uniswap V3 LP curve represents a unique non-fungible property right in a financial position on Blockchain Technology.*

[2] *“Blockchain” refers to a distributed ledger, maintained by a network of computers, that records all transactions of Virtual Assets in theoretically unchangeable data packages known as blocks, each of which are timestamped to reference the previous block, so that the blocks are linked in a chain that evidences the entire history of transactions of the Virtual Assets.*
